Gesture based control system is an automation system that interacts with AC devices based on the input provided as hand gesture.
The input image is then processed using OpenCV library to match the angle.
After the processing of image corresponding action is taken as defined in the algorithm.
The algorithm can be replicated across different platforms to perform various tasks such as 
Pattern recognition or any gesture based recognition for that matter.
